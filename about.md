This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Biodiversity Data Journal](https://bdj.pensoft.net/).

**Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ)** is a community peer-reviewed, open access, comprehensive online platform, designed to accelerate publishing, dissemination and sharing of biodiversity-related data of any kind. All structural elements of the articles – text, morphological descriptions, occurrences, data tables etc. – will be treated and stored as data, in accordance with the Data [Publishing Policies and Guidelines of Pensoft Publishers](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e12431).

The journal will publish papers in biodiversity science containing taxonomic, floristic/faunistic, morphological, genomic, phylogenetic, ecological or environmental data on any taxon of any geological era from any part of the world with no lower or upper limit to manuscript size. For example:

* single taxon treatments and nomenclatural acts (e.g., new taxa, new taxon names, new synonyms, changes in taxonomic status, re-descriptions, etc.);
* data papers describing biodiversity-related databases, including ecological and environmental data;
* sampling reports, local observations or occasional inventories, if these contain novel data;
* local or regional checklists and inventories;
* habitat-based checklists and inventories;
* ecological and biological observations of species and  communities;
* any kind of identification keys, from conventional dichotomous to multi-access interactive online keys;
* descriptions of biodiversity-related software tools.
