This is а GBIF Hosted Portal, displaying data extracted or associated with articles published in [Zoosystematics and Evolution](https://zse.pensoft.net/).

**Zoosystematics and Evolution** is an international, peer-reviewed life science journal devoted to the diversity, systematics and evolution of all animal groups, except for insects. It publishes original research and review articles at all taxonomic levels. Its scope encompasses primary information from collection-related research, taxonomic descriptions and discoveries, revisions, annotated type catalogues, relevant aspects of the history of science, and contributions on new methods and principles of taxonomy and systematics. Articles whose main topic is ecology, functional anatomy, physiology, or ethology are only acceptable when of clear systematic or evolutionary relevance and perspective. Studies on insects should be submitted to the sister journal of ZSE, Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift (DEZ).
